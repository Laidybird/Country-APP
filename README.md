#User Experience(UX/UI)

##Color Scheme

*For best readability and clean look was #080820 used for the background of the APP. The button was given the color of #3d64e6 and the text color for the button was given #ffffff. For the headline the color of #aliceblue was chosen because it stood out against the background. For when the search wrapper input I used #3d64e6. 
For container span I used #5d6274, and for alert i used #ff465a.

#Typography

*The Poppins is the font used throughout the whole website with Sans-serif as the fallback. The Robot font is clean, modern looking and it is easy to the eyes. It is sourced from Google Fonts and it is imported in the CSS document via @import.

##Deploiment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

*Locate the "Settings" button on the menu.
*Scroll down the settings page until you locate "Pages" in "code and automation" section.
*Under "Source", click the dropdown called "Select branch:" and select "Main", click the dropdown called "Select folder" and select "/root".
*The page will automatically refresh and you receive message "Your site is published at "https://laidybird.github.io/Country-APP/".

##Fork
If you want to fork this project with the intent to propose changes to the developer. It's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the original repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line.

*On GitHub.com, navigate to the https://github.com/laidybird/Country-APP/ repository.
*In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork Image
*Select an owner for the forked repository. image
*By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further. image
*Optionally, add a description of your fork. image
*Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork. For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open source projects, you only need to copy the default branch. By default only the default branch is copied. image
*Click Create fork image.

#Credits

Learning resources
*Code Institute - The JavaScript section and walkthrough project helped me alot in getting the knowledge needed.
*W3C School - When Code Institute could not give me the answer.
*JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development by Jon Duckett - When I needed to repeat or just see whatelse I could try when I was stuck.
*GitHub Docs was used when making the ### Fork section and ### Cloning your forked repository, the pictures and code is taken directly from there.
*Stackoverflow - I used this site alot to help with fixing and figuring out how to achieve certain things, for instance how to fix the timer ticking down I used this to help me figuring out what I did wrong.
